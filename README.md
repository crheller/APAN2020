# Code for poster/talk figures for APAN2020

### TODO
* Behavior analysis
    * Psychometric function
    * Learning effect?
* Single cell analysis (e.g. PSTH based analysis of active vs. passive vs. performance)
* Population analyses
    * Population visualization of data (PC space / TDR space / dPC space?)
    * Decoding accuracy for each SNR as fn of active / passive
    * Single trial choice probability (choice information in single trials?)


### Notes 10.11.2020

* Noise suppressed by behavior (raw noise corr. results)

* Change in rsc is correlated with behavior
    * Maybe show time bin breakdown?

* rsc axis is (isn't?) aligned with ideal decoding axis. 

* Ideal decoding performance increases (but is/isn't correlated with behavior)
    * To explain this, nice diagram. Also use temporal decoding?

* Noise suppression seems low dim (delta rsc plots, compare with raw pairwise noise correlations)
    * Is this axis correlated with behavior too?

* Noise is not aligned with discrimination axis for simple task (pure tone), but is more aligned for low SNR targets

* Conclusion would be that low-D noise is suppessed by engagement for the purpose of improving performance for difficult tasks
