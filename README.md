# Code for poster/talk figures for APAN2020

### TODO
* Behavior analysis
    * Psychometric function
    * Learning effect?
* Single cell analysis (e.g. PSTH based analysis of active vs. passive vs. performance)
* Population analyses
    * Population visualization of data (PC space / TDR space / dPC space?)
    * Decoding accuracy for each SNR as fn of active / passive
    * Single trial choice probability (choice information in single trials?)
